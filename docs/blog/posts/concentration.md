# Comparison of Concentration Measures

## Lorenz and naive Gini

## Clumpiness index (of top n %)

## Adjusted Gini

  - [x] gradually cluster random data and demonstrate how Adj Gini changes more than naive.
  - [x] is random data accurately modelled by a Poisson dist? (c.f negative binomial) - yes, with caveats
  - [ ] discuss the effect of uneven distributions  (spatial unit size, intensity)

## KDE

## Poisson-Gamma
