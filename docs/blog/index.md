# Summary

Unless otherwise stated, the crime data used in these posts is open data from [police.uk](https://data.police.uk)
and focusses on antisocial behaviour in the West Yorkshire force area in the past 3 years.

While the data provides precise spatial locations (perturbed? lat/lon and LSOA), temporal resolution is restricted to the month in which the crime
occurred. LSOA codes are not consistently 2021 codes and on occasion the lat/lon is a small distance outside the LSOA. For consistency, in all
analysis we use the lat/lon and map this to 2021 LSOA when aggregating at LSOA level.
