# EDA Documentation

Detailed investigations are found in the notebooks in this repo.

This site contains brief progress reports organised by category, mostly in the form of dated [blog articles](./blog/index.md)
summarising the analysis within the notebooks.

Where specific code has been written to facilitate these investigations, it has been written with reusability in mind.
Deliverables in this project include robust and professional software tools that Police can use to detect crime hotspots.

The notebooks import and use these code tools and general code should not be present in the notebooks themselves.
